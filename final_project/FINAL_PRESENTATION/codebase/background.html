<h1>Background:</h1>

Dexterity Check is a tool that identifies hand motor dysfunction by asking the participant to submit drawings of a circle, triangle, heart, and star.  Then four different algorithms are used to determine what shape the participant drew.  Your performance is measured simply as "scores" of the number of correctly identified shapes.  Every year approximately 800,000 people suffer from stroke which causes impairment of upper extremity functioning.  Reaching and grasping studies are performed to study hand and arm impairment.  Movement disorders are usually diagnosed with a neurological exam, MRI scan, or an electromyography.
